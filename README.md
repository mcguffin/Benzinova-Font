Benzinova Font Family
=====================

The Benzinova font family is a work in progress.
In the future the Benzinova is supposed to cover all font weights from 
100 (Thin) to 900 (Black). The aim is to achieve reliable numeric relationships between 
the font weights, having the Black weight being 9 times thicker than the Thin one.

The font editor is [RoboFont](http://robofont.com/). 
Different widths will be achieved using [Interpoltion Matrix](https://github.com/loicsander/Robofont-scripts/tree/master/Interpolation%20Matrix) by Lo√Øc Sander
